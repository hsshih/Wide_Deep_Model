## Wide and Deep Model

A wide and deep neural network that can be use to learn user preferences. The wide network complements the deep neural network by memorizing the individual user behaviors while the deep network makes generalizations based on the context features. The architecture is based on the paper [Deep Bayesian Bandits: Exploring in Online Personalized Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00727) by Guo et al. (2020).

### Usage

For a demonstration of how the wide and deep model can be used, take a look at the [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/hsshih/Wide_Deep_Model/blob/main/demo.ipynb). 

### Documentation

Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/hsshih/Wide_Deep_Model/blob/main/wide_deep_bandits_documentation.pdf) for more information on the model implementations and parameters.
